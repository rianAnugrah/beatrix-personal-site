                        The two designs above share the same approach: connecting students with expert coaches. However, the designers prefer to present the subtitle as a quote, as indicated in the first design.

                    <p class="mt-2.5">
                        The headlines are different because the first one was requested by the CEO to match the text from the previous website, while the second one was drafted by me as a second choice.

                    I'm sure many gamers listen to music through YouTube Music or Spotify, which is why the co-founder asked me to compare the plan with Spotify's. This inspired me to incorporate it into the content as part of our engagement strategy.

                    I worked mainly with founders who were a bit picky about the wording or statements related to esports, but I managed it. That's why I always provided multiple options for each page.

                    We need to keep iterating on design and content. I always find ways to listen to feedback from users and the team.

                <p class="mt-4 text-base">
                    Initially, I thought UX writing was just about text, but it's much more than that. We need to adjust the content based on accessibility principles and collaborative design. UX writers work closely with designers to ensure that text and design elements complement each other.
