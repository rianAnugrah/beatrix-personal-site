            After the revamp, we were ready to test it with users.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            We used Maze to conduct usability testing for our homepage. These were the key points that 12 users (5 esports players and 7 non-esports players) found most interesting:

        <p class="mt-4">
            As we are still new, we don't have much in the way of social proof or staff achievements. However, we will consider this for the next iteration.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            The positive takeaway was that users clearly understood all the details we provided on the website, <em class="font-semibold">including the services, subscription plans, and testimonials.</em>

            I felt relieved upon seeing the results from the subscription page. Users understood that each plan offers different services and their expectations regarding the number of learning hours were met.

            These were the results of what triggered users to subscribe to our plan:

            I faced a few challenges when trying to create better-written content for the esports website.

            Although I play some games, I still need to learn what esports looks like and put myself in the shoes of pro gamers.

        <p class="mt-4 text-base">
            I worked mainly with founders who were a bit picky about the wording or statements related to esports, but I managed it. That's why I always provided multiple options for each page.

        <p class="mt-4 text-base">
            We need to keep iterating on design and content. I always find ways to listen to feedback from users and the team.

        <p class="mt-4 text-base">
            Initially, I thought UX writing was just about text, but it's much more than that. We need to adjust the content based on accessibility principles and collaborative design. UX writers work closely with designers to ensure that text and design elements complement each other.

            The CEO and Co-Founder decided to change the company name to Savicore due to a copyright issue. As part of this, they also rebranded the entire font style and color scheme. I am also involved in this project, and I will include updates in my future case study.        </p>
