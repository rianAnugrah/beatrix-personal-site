            Analyzing and reviewing the previous Parabled website was the best approach before conducting user research and revamping the entire website directly.

            The alignment of the website seemed off <em class="font-semibold">due to the limitations of the website builder.</em> Customization options for alignment were limited.

            I understand this can be viewed from both a marketing and UX design perspective. However, to sell the item, we need to make the UI and content more visually appealing and engaging to attract users to click.
