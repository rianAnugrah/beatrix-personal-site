## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= v14.x
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  
Optional but recommended:

- [Astro CLI](https://docs.astro.build/getting-started/#install) (for easier development)

---

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-astro-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-astro-project

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

---

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
# Start the dev server
yarn dev
```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:3000` where you can view your site.

To build the project for production:

```bash

```

This will output the optimized static assets to the `dist/` folder.

Astro uses a configuration file (`astro.config.mjs`). Here are a few key settings you might want to customize:

- **`buildOptions`**: Configure where Astro outputs the build.
- **`site`**: Set your site's URL (used for SEO and RSS generation).
- **`integrations`**: Add Astro integrations like Tailwind, Svelte, etc.

Check out the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for more detailed configuration options.

1. Build the static files:
   ```bash
